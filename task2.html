    <h1>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</h1>
    </p>
    <h1>Early life</h1><hr>
    <p>Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) 
        (now in Madhya Pradesh).He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and
        Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.His family was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe (Mandangad taluka) in
        Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra. Ambedkar was born into a Mahar (dalit) caste, who were treated as untouchables and 
        subjected to socio-economic discrimination. Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the British East India Company, 
        and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment. Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other
        untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class.
        When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch
        either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if
        the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No Water"
        .He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him.

    <h1>Education</h1><hr>
    <p>In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at Elphinstone High School. In 1906,
        when he was about 15 years old, he married a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai. The match was arranged by the couple's parents, in 
        accordance with prevailing custom at that time
        In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered Elphinstone College, which was affiliated to the University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.[21]

    <h1>Political career</h1><hr>
    <p>In 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the Government Law College, Bombay, a position he held for two years. He also served 
        as the chairman of Governing body of Ramjas College, University of Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath. 
        Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more 
        than 50,000 books.[49] His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year. It had been her long-standing wish to go on a 
        pilgrimage to Pandharpur, but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead 
        of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables. At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar 
        announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave Hinduism. He would repeat his
        message at many public meetings across India.
