    <h3>Sambhar Recipe</h3></center>

    <p>Sambar is a South Indian lentil and vegetable stew made with pigeon pea lentils, tamarind 
        and a unique spice blend called sambar powder. It is a staple dish in South Indian homes
         and is also equally popular and loved by many.</p>
        <h3>Preparation and Cooking Lentils</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Before we begin making sambar, it always helps to soak tamarind in water earlier. So soak 1 tablespoon tamarind in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the tamarind gets soft, then squeeze the tamarind in the water itself. Discard the strained tamarind and keep the tamarind pulp aside.</li>
            <li>Rinse ½ cup tuvar dal (100 grams) a couple of times in fresh and clean water. You can use a strainer to rinse the lentils.</li>
            <li>Drain all the water and add the dal in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker. Also add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.</li>
            <li>Add 1.5 to 1.75 cups of water and mix to combine</li>
            <li> Cover and pressure cook dal for 7 to 8 whistles or 9 to 10 minutes on medium heat. </li>
            <li>When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and check the dal. The dal should be completely cooked and mushy.</li>
            <li>When the dal is pressure cooking – rinse, peel and chop the vegetables. When making sambar, chop the vegetables which get cooked faster in large sizes like pumpkin, brinjals (small aubergines) okra, drumsticks etc.

            Vegetables which take more time to cook are to be chopped in small sizes like carrots, potatoes, etc. I have chopped the pumpkin in large cubes and the carrots and potatoes in small cubes.</li>
            <li>Take 1 to 1.5 cups chopped vegetables in a pan or pot. Also add 6 to 7 pearl onions or 1 small to medium onion (thickly sliced) and 1 small to medium tomato (quartered)</li>
            <li> Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder and salt as per taste.

                Adding kashmiri red chili powder is optional and can be skipped. I add it for a nice bright color in the sambar.</li>
            <li>Add 1.5 to 2 cups water and stir. Add enough water so that they cover the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Keep the pan on a stove top and begin to cook vegetables on a medium-low to medium heat. In between do check when the vegetables are cooking.</li>
            <li>Cook till the vegetables are almost done. Ensure that you don’t overcook the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Add the prepared tamarind pulp to the cooked vegetables. If you don’t have dried tamarind then use packaged or bottled tamarind paste.</li>
            <li>Simmer on a medium-low heat till it comes to a boil. Stir at intervals. You will see a frothy layer on top when the sambar begins boiling. </li>

        </ul>
